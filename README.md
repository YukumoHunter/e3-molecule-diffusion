# Equivariant Diffusion for Molecule Generation in 3D
## Archelaos Chalkiadakis, Harold Ruiter, Marina Orozco Gonzalez, Ricardo Chavez Torres, Robin Reitsma

The main objectives of our project are:
1. Do a thorough review of the current literature on geometric deep learning
for molecule generation.
2. Reproduce the results of Equivariant Diffusion Hoogeboom et al. (2022)
3. Implement the Equivariant Diffusion Hoogeboom et al. (2022) algorithm
in JAX.
4. Measure efficiency and performance in JAX in comparison to to Pytorch
implementation

Even though we haven't finish our implementation in Jax yet (progess can be checked in [src](e3-molecule-diffusion\src) ), we expect a significant improvement in **training time** by using JAX.

A first draft of our blogpost can be fount at [blogpost.md](e3-molecule-diffusion\blogpost.md).
